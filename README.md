# SMART-BABY-CRADLE
This cradle swings automatically on detection of baby cry sound. Also it activates buzzer and gives alerts to baby’s parent if: first, baby cry continues till specific time which means now cradle cannot handle baby and baby needs personal attention and  second, if the mattress in the cradle is wet. 

# INTRODUCTION
This cradle swings automatically on detection of baby cry sound. Also it activates buzzer and gives alerts to baby’s parent if:
first, baby cry continues till specific time which means now cradle cannot handle baby and baby needs personal attention and 
second, if the mattress in the cradle is wet.
So by the help of Smart baby cradle ,constant monitoring of the baby inside the cradle will be done. If any activity such as urination or baby waking up from sleep gives alert to baby’s parent.
